and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms. With a few
simple annotations you can quickly enable and configure the common patterns inside your
application and build large distributed systems with Zookeeper based components. The
patterns provided include Service Discovery and Configuration.
Intelligent Routing (Zuul) and Client Side Load Balancing (Ribbon), Circuit Breaker
